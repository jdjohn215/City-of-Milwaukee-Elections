# City of Milwaukee Elections Data
This repo is a work-in-progress. It contains resources for analyzing local, state, and national elections in the City of Milwaukee.

## Resources
Currently, resources include:

* election results - in `/election-data/`
* census data by ward - in `/census-data/`
* crosswalks between old and new wards - `/census-data/Ward2011_to_Ward2021_ByVAP.csv`
* old and new ward boundaries - `/boundaries/`

## Goals

In the future, I plan to add more election results, maps and analysis of past elections, and scrapers for pulling election night provisional returns.
